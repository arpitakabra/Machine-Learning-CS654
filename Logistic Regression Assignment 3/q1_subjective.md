Train and test accuracy for lambda = 0.5

Train accuracy:  55.00000000000001 | Test accuracy:  52.5

Batch Size is 1.

The accuracies obtained in unregulrized logistic regression are higher than that of L2 Norm Regularized. It is so because, theta is not constrained in unregularized and hence fits well. 

The misclassified points are from the two quadrants through which the fitted line passes. 


In the plot for loss vs iterations, the average loss of unregularized regression is less than that of regularized regression till the final iteration.
